# 7. Extinguish fire as an operator

Before we make our first cut as an operator, we need to be able
to extinguish a fire when it occurs.

## Exercise

On your own, do [all the steps](../steps/) until (i.e. without) 'Start laser':

- For material, use a match
- For the design, use a very small circle
- The laser is set up to cut the head of the match, using the settings
  in this guide
- Test that the head of the match will indeed be hit by the laser,
  using the 'Frame' functionality

Find a controller.
You will be responsible for extinguishing the fire!

## Exercise 1: dry run

The first exercise is a dry run of what needs to be done:

- Do the regular safety procedure
- You say: 'laser started'
- You say: 'fire'
- You pretend to click 'Stop' in LightBurn
- You open the enclosure
- You pretend to extinguish the fire

## Exercise 2: for real

In the second exercise, you will extinguish the fire

- Do the regular safety procedure
- Start the laser and say: 'laser started'
- When the first starts, you say: 'fire'
- In LightBurn, you click on 'Stop'
- You open the procedure
- You extinguish the fire

## Exam

Do exercise 2 without errors.
