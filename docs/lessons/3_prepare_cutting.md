# 3. Prepare for cutting

There are multiple things that need to be done
before the laser cutter can start.

## Exercise

Do [all the steps](../steps/) until (i.e. without) 'Start laser'.

- For material, use regular paper
- For the design, use any drawing you like: just a circle is perfectly fine
- The laser is set up to cut through the paper, using the settings
  in this guide
- Test that the design will indeed be correctly cut out off the paper,
  using the 'Frame' functionality

## Exam

Do the exercise in 10 minutes, without any help.

- The ventilation must be on
- The laser is at the correct physical height
- The laser must be set up to cut through the paper
- The paper is place there where the laser is cut

You pass if indeed you've prepared correctly for laser cutting.
