# 1. Be a good controller

To use the laser, two people are needed:

- Operator: the person that starts the laser
- Controller: the person that double-checks the operator

Both roles are needed to work with a laser safely.

In this lesson, we practive being a good controller.

- Find an operator to use the laser
- Read the procedure for the operator

!!! info "Procedure for the operator"

    Step|Do                                             |Check by operator
    ----|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
    1   |Say 'Air is on'                                |The green light is on
    2   |Say 'I am wearing my goggles'                  |You have your goggles on
    3   |Say 'You are wearing your goggles'             |You assistant has his/her goggles on
    4   |Say 'Those behind us are wearing their goggles'|All those behind you (if any) have goggles on
    5   |Say '3, 2, 1'                                  |Nobody says 'stop'
    6   |Press start                                    |Nobody says 'stop'
    7   |Say 'Laser is on'                              |Laser is on, hand is on laser casing

    9   |Say 'Laser is off'                             |Laser is on

**In this session, we never start the laser**.
All the operator says is 'Laser is on'.

- During countdown, say 'stop'
- You and the operator pass if the laser is not started

## Exercise 2: test the operator
