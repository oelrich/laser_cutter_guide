# 5. Your first cut as a controller

Finally, we make our first cut!

## Exercise

On your own, do [all the steps](../steps/) until (i.e. without) 'Start laser':

- For material, use any material that is fast to cut
- For the design, use a very small circle
- The laser is set up to cut the material, using the settings
  in this guide
- Test that the material will indeed be hit by the laser,
  using the 'Frame' functionality

Find a controller to be responsible for starting the laser.

## Exercise 1: dry run

The first exercise is a dry run of what needs to be done:

- Do the safety procedure as usual
- The operator says: 'laser started'
- The operator says: 'all is well'
- The operator says: 'laser done'

## Exercise 2: demonstration by operator

In the second exercise, the operator shows how this must be done:

- The operator follows the regular procedure for starting the laser
  and starts the laser
- The operator will say: 'laser started', 'all is well' and 'laser done'
- The operator turns off the laser and opens the enclosure
- Take out the material, see if it worked

## Exam

Do exercise 2 without errors.
