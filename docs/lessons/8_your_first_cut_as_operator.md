# 8. Your first cut as an operator

Finally, we make our first cut!

## Exercise

On your own, do [all the steps](../steps/) until (i.e. without) 'Start laser':

- For material, use a match
- For the design, use a very small circle
- The laser is set up to cut the head of the match, using the settings
  in this guide
- Test that the head of the match will indeed be hit by the laser,
  using the 'Frame' functionality

Find a controller.

Find a controller to be responsible for starting the laser.

## Exercise 1: dry run

The first exercise is a dry run of what needs to be done:

- Do the safety procedure as usual
- You say: 'laser started'
- You say: 'all is well'
- You say: 'laser done'

## Exercise 2: for real

In the second exercise, you make your first cut!

- Do the safety procedure as usual
- You say: 'laser started', 'all is well' and 'laser done'
- You turn off the laser and opens the enclosure
- You take out the material, see if it worked

## Exam
